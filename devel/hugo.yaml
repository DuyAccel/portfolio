          I was amazed by how a real data product is created. During this time, I have gained a lot of knowledge about Docker and Jenkins. I also started using some common services of AWS to host and testing my project.
          
          - Deploy first website on a server.
          - Config Jenkins nodes to auto pull code from github, build image, push image to dockerhub.
